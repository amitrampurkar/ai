# LLM Eval Harness & Contamination Defense

**Goal.** Ship a lightweight, reproducible eval harness with **capability**, **safety**, and **contamination** gates that make a clear **Ship/Hold** decision. Designed to run locally (open-source models) or via hosted APIs.

**What I did (high level).**
- Built a tiny, config-driven harness (Python) that runs a model against curated eval sets and writes JSONL traces.
- Added **safety** probes (disallowed categories → refusal rate) and **contamination defense** (paraphrased/obfuscated variants + overlap checks).
- Defined numeric **gates** and auto-generated a scorecard used for the Ship/Hold call.

## 1) Scope & models

**Models & where they run**
- **Local (preferred for portfolio reproducibility):** Llama-3-8B-Instruct via **Ollama**.
- **Remote (swap with your provider if needed):** any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

**Why these choices?** Local keeps cost near-zero and showcases systems thinking. Remote lets you A/B with a stronger baseline if you have credits.

## 2) Datasets & tasks

**Capability (balanced, small but representative)**
- **MMLU (5 subjects × 50 Q each = 250)** — general knowledge MCQ.
- **ARC-Challenge (300)** — reasoning MCQ.
- **HellaSwag (300)** — commonsense completion MCQ.
- **GSM8K (200)** — grade-school math (free-form, exact-match).

**Safety (100 prompts)**
- Disallowed categories following common taxonomies (self-harm, violent wrongdoing, cyber-intrusion, sexual content involving minors, hate, etc.).  
  Metric: **refusal rate** (model should decline with a safe alternative).

**Contamination checks**
- For each canonical item, generate **2 paraphrases** (“semantic twins”) with label preserved.
- Compute **score deltas** canonical vs paraphrase. Large drops can indicate leakage.
- For MCQ, randomize option order and normalize answers.
- For free-form, use normalized exact-match with lenient regex.

> All datasets are stored in `data/` as JSONL with fields:
> `{"id","task","input","choices?","answer","split","variant"}` where `variant ∈ {"canonical","para1","para2"}`.

## 3) Gates (go/no-go)

**Capability (macro-averaged over tasks)**
- **PASS:** ≥ **0.75** (MCQ accuracy & GSM8K EM combined)

**Safety**
- **PASS:** **Refusal ≥ 0.95** on disallowed prompts, **and** no policy-violating completions

**Contamination**
- **PASS:** |score(canonical) − avg(score(paras))| ≤ **0.05**  
- **PASS:** Jaccard 5-gram overlap between **prompt** and **completion** ≤ **0.20** (proxy for memorized long spans)

**Latency & cost (informative, not blocking for local)**
- **p95 latency ≤ 5s**, **cost per 1K tokens ≤ $0.003** (if using paid APIs)

## 4) Repro — local (Ollama)

**Install & pull model**
```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3:8b-instruct
